            <p><strong>Early Life and Education:</strong> After completing my National Senior Certificate at Qoqisizwe High School in 2017, my initial career aspirations were focused on physiotherapy and pharmacy. I was accepted at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, but due to an over-acceptance of students, I had to seek alternatives. Determined not to take a gap year, I enrolled in ICT (Business Analysis) at Durban University of Technology in 2018.</p>   
            <p>It was during my undergraduate studies that I developed a growing passion for technology. In 2019, I received an email from Mrs. Fatima about a new Bachelor of ICT program that required students with strong mathematics skills. Given my excellent performance in mathematics during high school, I was drawn to this opportunity and decided to continue in the ICT field. I earned my Bachelor’s degree from 2019 to 2022, followed by an Honours degree in ICT in 2023.</p>
            <p><strong>Career:</strong> My professional journey began with a six-month stint as a Software Developer at Africa Learn, where I gained hands-on experience in implementing security best practices, enhancing Azure features, and monitoring application performance. Currently, I serve as an LMS Specialist at Lead HR Consulting, where I have successfully implemented multi-factor authentication, managed the Learning Management System, and delivered comprehensive demos.</p>
            <p><strong>Achievement:</strong> Throughout my journey, I have been recognized for my exceptional skills and accomplishments. Notably, I was awarded the Excellent Prize at the BRICS Skills Competition, showcasing my expertise in data analysis and visualization. Additionally, I secured 3rd place in the Data Analysis and Visualization category at the same competition. My technical prowess has also been validated through various certifications, including Microsoft Azure Fundamentals, Microsoft Azure Administrator, and Microsoft Certified: Azure DevOps. Furthermore, I have achieved proficiency in MATLAB and Simulink and obtained the MITRE ATT&CK Defender Certification. My innovative approach also earned me the L'Oréal Brandstorm Certificate.</p>
            <p><strong>Voluntary Work:</strong> Giving back to the community has always been important to me. As a Camp Leader at YMCA (Nov 2018 - Feb 2019), I managed daily activities, ensured safety protocols, and resolved conflicts among staff and campers. Additionally, as a Committee Member at Varsity Genie since 2024, I have mentored students, facilitated engagement, and encouraged active participation in various educational programs.</p>
            <p><strong>Personal Philosophy:</strong> Throughout my life, I have learned that resilience, adaptability, and continuous learning are essential for success. I strive to leverage technology to solve complex problems and drive innovation.</p>
